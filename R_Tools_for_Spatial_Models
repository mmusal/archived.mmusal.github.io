Both R and Python have libraries that can process files referred to as "shape files". Details on the definition and development of the format can be read at [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile). An important thing to know is that whereas shape file refers to data that is used to represent geographical features, it needs 3 files for it to be operational.
### *.shp
### *.shx
### *.dbf
