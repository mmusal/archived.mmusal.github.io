Both R and Python have libraries that can process files referred to as "shape files". Details on the definition and development of the format can be read at [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile). An important thing to know is that whereas shape file refers to data that is used to represent geographical features, it needs 3 files to be operational.
# *.shp 
where coordinates of geographical features are kept.
# *.shx
an indexing file for geometric features.
# *.dbf
data that is associated with the geometric features.
